Just uploaded a better working script.  There are some minor changes to the ouput that I need to tweek.  However, the person that is using this script in production is happy with the current results.  The current script has shaved hours off the old way they were doing this.  I hope you and your co-workers enjoy what I have started and improve upon it.
